# My OSCE3 Study Guide 
Welcome to my OSCE3 Study Guide repository! This study guide is designed to support aspiring cybersecurity professionals in their preparation for the Offensive Security Certified Expert 3 (OSCE3) certification. This repo covers essential topics such as advanced web exploit development, reverse engineering, and network-level attacks. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting your journey in offensive security, this repository provides a structured approach to completing the OSCE3 certification.

## OSWE
By completing this excellent certification, you will be able to achieve the following:
- Learn expert-level web attacks and exploitation techniques
- Understanding how to chain multiple vulnerabilities
- Write a fully automated exploit to compromise a web app
- Ability to recognize common programmer mistakes
- Develop in-depth source code review methodology

Tools and Methodologies
- Traffic Inspection: Burpsuite, Foxyproxy
- Frameworks: Java, PHP, Python, .Net, NodeJS
- Source Code Discovery and Analysis: dnSpy, JD-GUI, Visual Studio Code, Sublime

Difficulty - You need to perform the source code review directly on the machine provided by OffSec. Reading and analyzing the code was frustrating because of the delayed responses of the remote machine and required significant concentration.
